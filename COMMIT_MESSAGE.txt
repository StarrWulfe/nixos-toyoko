Refactored flake layout and host/profile composition

- Reworked flake to use modular hosts and profiles.
- Added `hosts/` directory with host-specific defaults (toyoko, virtua, randall,
  gohan3 (darwin)).
- Introduced `profiles/` for base and desktop profiles (gnome/xfce) to make it
  easy to switch desktops per host.
- Kept Home Manager user module at `modules/home/default.nix` and preserved
  user packages and aliases.
- Added a top-level README describing flake structure and how to switch
  desktops; this repo is now suited for ZaneyOS-style composition.

This is a structural refactor intended to make machines composable and easy
to extend; no runtime behavior changes were made beyond reorganizing modules.
